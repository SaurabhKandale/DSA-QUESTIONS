# DSA-QUESTIONS
Hey Guys, ***Saurabh*** here,

In this file I will be adding links of some good DSA questions that I have practised.

Most of the questions will be from Leetcode and GeeksForGeeks.
- [Number of Strings That Appear as Substrings in Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-strings-that-appear-as-substrings-in-word/)
- [Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/submissions/)
- [Subsets II](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/)
